# CloudXR Unity Plugin Demo
A Unity project that demonstrates the CloudXR Unity Plugin issues we are experiencing.

This was built following the [CXR Unity guide]([url](https://docs.nvidia.com/cloudxr-sdk/unity_guide/guide.html)https://docs.nvidia.com/cloudxr-sdk/unity_guide/guide.html). It was built with Unity 2022.2.12f1 as the guide reccomends.

By following this guide we can get into a CloudXR 4.0 stream, but the projection of the shader is off.
